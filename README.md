## What is Live Demo?

A progressive web application that allows people to connect with their team to quickly and effortlessly record and share demo recordings. Whether your team has access to a desktop or mobile phone, everyone can join a session, no account required.

## Inspiration
The pandemic has caused many events to go virtual, this includes our beloved hackathons. In person, demoing your proof of concept at the end of a hackathon is easy however with everything online, this becomes more complicated. To create your recording you need programs to record and edit as well as oftentimes video conferencing applications to hear one another. Just if there was a simple website, that would allow your entire team to record a demo from any device, without requiring an accountâ€¦

## How it works
Live Demo allows anyone to quickly host a peer-to-peer session that anyone can join. Once your entire team joins the session (no accounts required for anyone) you are able to start, play and pause recordings, turn on video cameras and microphones, and share your screen. We plan on adding a file transferring feature as well as a real-time collaborative whiteboard. Built using Websockets, WebRTC, Azure, React, HTML, CSS, TS.
